in Above image we can clearly see, for index 8, height is 4, so we will see what is nearest minimum height on left which is 7

And what is minimum nearest height on right? which is 12. so we can say we have total 4 bars which are making an rectangle, and 12-7-1=4

and Area= 4*4=16

we will apply same on each bar and maintain the maximum
